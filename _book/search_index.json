不足64字节的话，处理器会将他们都读到同一个高速缓存行中，在多处理器下每个处理器都缓存同样的头、尾节点，当一个处理器试图修改头节点时，会将整个缓存行锁定，那么在缓存一致性机制的作用下，会导致其他处理器不能访问自己高速缓存中的尾节点，而队列的入队和出队操作则需要不停修改头节点和尾节点，所以在多处理器的情况下将会严重影响到队列的效率。使用追加到64字节的方式来填满高速缓冲区的缓存行，避免头、尾节点加载到同一个缓存行，使头、尾节点在修改时不会互相锁定。","书籍来源：《java并发编程的艺术》——方腾飞，魏鹏，程晓明。","什么是资源限制","以下两种场景不应该使用这种方式：","使用最少线程。避免创建不需要的线程，比如任务很少，但是创建了很多线程来处理，这样会造成大量线程都处于等待状态。","共享变量不会被频繁的写。","内存屏障","写命中","写缺失","减少上下文切换的方法有无锁并发编程、cas算法、使用最少线程和使用协程。","利用synchronized实现同步的基础：java中的每一个对象都可以作为锁。表现为以下3种形式：","协程。在单线程里实现多任务的调度，并在单线程里维持多个任务间的切换。","即使是单核处理器也支持多线程执行代码，cpu通过给每个线程分配cpu时间片来实现这个机制。时间片是cpu分配给各个线程的时间。因为时间片非常短，所以cpu通过不断的切换线程执行，让我们感觉多个线程是同时执行的，时间片一般是几十毫秒。","原子操作","在多线程并发编程中synchronized一直是元老级的角色，很多人会称呼它为重量级锁。","在多线程并发编程中synchronized和volatile都扮演着重要的角色，volatile是轻量级的synchronized，它在多处理开发中保证了共享变量的“可见性”。可见性的意思是当一个线程修改一个共享变量时，另一个线程能读到这个修改的指。如果volatitle变量修饰符使用恰当的话，它比synchronized的使用和执行成本更低，因为他不会引起线程上下文的切换和调度。","在并发编程中，将代码执行速度加快的原则是将代码中串行的部分变成并发执行，但是如果将某段串行的代码并发执行，因为受限于资源，仍然在串行执行，这时候程序不仅不会加快执行，反而会更慢，因为增加了上下文切换是资源调度的时间。","在资源限制情况下进行并发编程","多线程一定快吗？","如何减少上下文切换","如何在资源限制的情况下，让程序执行的更快呢？方法就是，根据不同的资源限制调整程序的并发度，比如下载文件程序依赖于两个资源——带宽和硬盘读写速度。","如何解决资源限制的问题","如果进行高速缓存行填充操作的内存位置仍然是下次处理器访问的地址时，处理从缓存中读取操作数，而不是从内存读取","对于同步方法块，锁是synchonized括号里配置的对象。","对于数据库锁，加锁和解锁必须在一个数据库连接里，否则会出现解锁失败的情况。","对于普通同步方法，锁是当前实例对象。","对于硬件资源限制，可以考虑使用集群并行执行程序。对于软件资源限制，可以考虑使用资源池将资源复用。","对于静态同步方法，锁是当前类的class对象。","将当前处理器缓存行的数据写回到系统内存。","尝试使用定时锁，使用lock.trylock(timeout)来替代使用内部锁机制。","并发执行耗时/m","并发比串行快多少","并发编程的挑战","并发编程的目的是为了让程序运行得更快，但并不是启动更多的线程就能让程序最大限度的并发执行。下面介绍几种并发编程的挑战以及解决方案。","当一个线程试图访问同步代码块时，它首先必须得到锁，退出或抛出异常时必须释放锁。从jvm规范中可以看到synchonized在jvm里的实现原理，jvm基于进入和退出monitor对象来实现方法同步和代码块同步，但两者的实现细节不一样。具体可以详细查阅jvm规范。","当处理器将操作数写回到一个内存缓存的区域时，它首先会检查这个缓存的内存地址是否在缓存行中，如果存在一个有效的缓存行，则处理器将这个操作数写回到缓存，而不是写回到内存","当处理器识别到从内存中读取操作数是可缓存的，处理器读取整个高速缓存行到适当的缓存(l1，l2，l3的或所有)","循环次数","快","慢","无锁并发编程。多线程竞争锁时，会引起上下文切换，所以多线程处理数据时，可以用一些方法来避免使用锁。","有volatile变量修饰的共享变量进行写操作的时候会多出第二行汇编代码，lock前缀的指令在多核处理器下会引发两件事情。","术语","术语描述","死锁","测试结果显示，当并发执行累计不超过1亿次的时候，速度会比串行执行要慢，因为线程有创建和上下文切换的开销。","缓冲行","缓存命中","缓存行填充","缓存行非64字节宽的处理器。","联系邮箱：imdreamer68@gmail.com","英文单词","著名的java并发编程大师doug","资源限制引发的问题","资源限制是指在进行并发编程时，程序的执行速度受限于计算机硬件资源或软件资源。","资源限制的挑战","转换为汇编代码，如下：","这个写回内存的操作会使在其他cpu里缓存了改内存地址的数据无效。","这是本人在阅读《java并发编程的艺术》时写的笔记，方便自己查看。如有一些错误或者有异议的地方，请指正，谢谢！","追加字节能优化性能。linkedtransferqueue这个类，它使用一个内部类类型来定义队列的头节点和尾节点，而这个内部类paddedatomicreference相对于父类atomicreference只做了一件事情，就是将共享变量追加到64字节。有个对象的引用占4个字节，追加了15个占60个字节，再加上父类的value变量共64个字节。","避免一个线程同时获取多个锁。","避免一个线程在锁内同时占用多个资源，尽量保证每个锁只占用一个资源。","避免死锁的几个常见方法。","那么是不是在使用volatile变量时都应该追加到64字节呢？","锁是个非常有用的工具，运用场景非常多，因为它使用起来非常简单，而且易于理解。但同时它也会带来一些困扰，那就是可能会引起死锁，一旦产生死锁，就会造成系统功能不可用。","锁的升级与对比"],"pipeline":["stopWordFilter","stemmer"]},"store":{"./":{"url":"./","title":"README","summary":"My

line\nCPU高速缓存中可以分配的最小存储单位。处理器填写缓存行时会加载整个缓存行，现代CPU需要执行几百次CPU指令\n\n\n原子操作\natomic operations\n不可中断的一个或一系列操作\n\n\n缓存行填充\ncacha line fill\n当处理器识别到从内存中读取操作数是可缓存的，处理器读取整个高速缓存行到适当的缓存(L1，L2，L3的或所有)\n\n\n缓存命中\ncache hit\n如果进行高速缓存行填充操作的内存位置仍然是下次处理器访问的地址时，处理从缓存中读取操作数，而不是从内存读取\n\n\n写命中\nwrite hit\n当处理器将操作数写回到一个内存缓存的区域时，它首先会检查这个缓存的内存地址是否在缓存行中，如果存在一个有效的缓存行，则处理器将这个操作数写回到缓存，而不是写回到内存\n\n\n写缺失\nwrite misses the cache\n一个有效的缓存行被写入到不存在的内存区域\n\n\n\nvolatile是如何来保证可见性的呢？\nJava代码如下：\ninstance = new Singleton();\n\n转换为汇编代码，如下：\n0x01a3deld: movb $0×0,0×1104800(%esi);0x01a3de24: lock add1 $0×0,(%esp);\n\n有volatile变量修饰的共享变量进行写操作的时候会多出第二行汇编代码，Lock前缀的指令在多核处理器下会引发两件事情。\n\n将当前处理器缓存行的数据写回到系统内存。\n这个写回内存的操作会使在其他CPU里缓存了改内存地址的数据无效。\n\n为了提高处理速度，处理器不直接和内存进行通信，而是先将系统内存的数据读到内部缓存(L1，L2或其他)后再进行操作，但操作完不知道何时会写到内存。如果对声明了volatile的变量进行写操作，JVM会向处理器发送一条Lock前缀的指令，将这个变量所在的缓存行的数据写回到系统内存。但是，就算写回到内存，如果其他处理器缓存的值还是旧的，再执行计算操作就会有问题。所以在多处理器下，为了保证各个处理器的缓存是一致的，就回实现缓存一致性协议，每个处理器通过嗅探在总线上传播的数据来检查自己缓存的值是不是过期了，当处理器发现自己缓存行对应的内存地址被修改，就会将当前处理的缓存行设置成无效状态，当处理器对这个数据进行修改操作时，会重新从系统内存中吧数据读到处理缓存里。\nvolatile的两条实现原则\n\nLock前缀指令会引起处理器缓存会写到内存。\n一个处理器的缓存回写到内存会导致其他处理器的缓存无效。\n\nvolatile的使用优化\n著名的Java并发编程大师Doug lea在JDK 7的并发包里新增一个队列集合类LinkedTransferQueue，它在使用volatile变量时，用一种追加字节的方式来优化队列出队和入队的性能。\nLinkedTransferQueue的代码如下：\n/*队列中的头部节点*/\nprivate transient final PaddedAtomicReference head;\n/*队列中的尾部节点*/\nprivate transient final PaddedAtomicReference tail;\nstatic final class PaddedAtomicReference  extends AtomicReference  {\n    //使用很多4个字节的引用追加到64字节\n    Object P0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, pa, pb, pc, pd, pe;\n    PaddedAtomicReference(T r) {\n        super();\n    }\n}\npublic class AtomicReference  implements java.io.Serializable {\n    private volatile V value;\n    //省略其他代码\n}\n\n追加字节能优化性能。LinkedTransferQueue这个类，它使用一个内部类类型来定义队列的头节点和尾节点，而这个内部类PaddedAtomicReference相对于父类AtomicReference只做了一件事情，就是将共享变量追加到64字节。有个对象的引用占4个字节，追加了15个占60个字节，再加上父类的value变量共64个字节。\n为什么追加64字节能够提高并发编程的效率呢？对于目前主流的处理器的L1，L2或L3缓存的高速缓存行是64个字节宽，不支持部分填充缓存行，这意味着，如果队列的头节点和尾节点都不足64字节的话，处理器会将他们都读到同一个高速缓存行中，在多处理器下每个处理器都缓存同样的头、尾节点，当一个处理器试图修改头节点时，会将整个缓存行锁定，那么在缓存一致性机制的作用下，会导致其他处理器不能访问自己高速缓存中的尾节点，而队列的入队和出队操作则需要不停修改头节点和尾节点，所以在多处理器的情况下将会严重影响到队列的效率。使用追加到64字节的方式来填满高速缓冲区的缓存行，避免头、尾节点加载到同一个缓存行，使头、尾节点在修改时不会互相锁定。\n那么是不是在使用volatile变量时都应该追加到64字节呢？\n以下两种场景不应该使用这种方式：\n\n缓存行非64字节宽的处理器。\n共享变量不会被频繁的写。\n\nsynchronized的实现原理与应用\n在多线程并发编程中synchronized一直是元老级的角色，很多人会称呼它为重量级锁。\n利用synchronized实现同步的基础：Java中的每一个对象都可以作为锁。表现为以下3种形式：\n\n对于普通同步方法，锁是当前实例对象。\n对于静态同步方法，锁是当前类的Class对象。\n对于同步方法块，锁是Synchonized括号里配置的对象。\n\n当一个线程试图访问同步代码块时，它首先必须得到锁，退出或抛出异常时必须释放锁。从JVM规范中可以看到Synchonized在JVM里的实现原理，JVM基于进入和退出Monitor对象来实现方法同步和代码块同步，但两者的实现细节不一样。具体可以详细查阅JVM规范。\nJava对象头\nsynchronized用的锁是存在Java对象头里的。如果对象是数组类型，则虚拟机用3个字宽存储对象头，如果对象是非数组类型，则用2个字款存储对象头。在32位虚拟机中，1字款等于4字节，即32bit。\n锁的升级与对比\nJava SE 1.6为了减少获得锁和释放锁带来的性能消耗，引入了“偏向锁”和“轻量级锁”，在Java SE 1.6中，锁一共有4种状态，级别从低到高依次是：无锁状态、偏向锁状态、轻量级锁状态和重量级锁状态，这几个状态会随着竞争情况逐渐升级。锁可以升级但不能降级，目的是为了提高获得锁和释放锁的效率。\n"}}}
